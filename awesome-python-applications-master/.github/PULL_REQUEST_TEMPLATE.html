<h2 id="qualifications">Qualifications</h2>
<p>There are a ton of great Python projects out there, but what makes an application “Awesome™”? Please check that all of the following criteria apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Free software with an online source repository.</li>
<li>[ ] Using Python for a considerable part of their functionality.</li>
<li>[ ] Well-known, or at least prominently used in an identifiable niche.</li>
<li>[ ] Maintained or otherwise demonstrably still functional on relevant platforms.</li>
<li>[ ] An application, not a library or framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that installability via pip/PyPI and a developer-audience focus may warrant a higher standard for inclusion, in keeping with the spirit of the list: http://sedimental.org/awesome_python_applications.html</p>
