<p>As developers, we spend our days with code. The site youâ€™re reading this on is mostly modules, packages, libraries, frameworks, and the like. But users see applications.</p>
<p>When building our own applications, open-source Python applications are a gold mine of practical patterns that we know work together. A production application is worth a thousand blog posts and Stack Overflow answers.</p>
<p>This document is an always-growing list of <strong>{TOTAL_COUNT}</strong> open-source Python applications arranged by topic, with links to repositories, docs, and more, generated from <a href="https://github.com/mahmoud/awesome-python-applications/blob/master/projects.yaml">structured data</a> using <a href="https://github.com/mahmoud/apatite">apatite</a>.
