As developers, we spend our days with code. The site you're reading
this on is mostly modules, packages, libraries, frameworks, and the
like. But users see applications.

When building our own applications, open-source Python applications
are a gold mine of practical patterns that we know work together. A
production application is worth a thousand blog posts and Stack
Overflow answers.

This document is an always-growing list of **{TOTAL_COUNT}**
open-source Python applications arranged by topic, with links to
repositories, docs, and more, generated from [structured
data](https://github.com/mahmoud/awesome-python-applications/blob/master/projects.yaml)
using [apatite](https://github.com/mahmoud/apatite). If you have one
to add or find some information missing, [please let us
know](https://github.com/mahmoud/awesome-python-applications/issues)!
