* **[Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower)**: Bower offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of front-end package management, while exposing the package dependency model via an API that can be consumed by a more opinionated build stack.
* **[Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna)**: Lerna is a tool that optimizes the workflow around managing multi-package repositories with git and npm.
* **[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)**: NPM makes it easy for JavaScript developers to share and reuse code, and it makes it easy to update the code that you're sharing.
